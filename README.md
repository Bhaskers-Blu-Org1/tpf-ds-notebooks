# TPF Data Science Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks explore the capability and value of utilizing data science to extract valuable insights on a z/TPF system. They provide an interactive educational platform by containing a mixture of embedded documentation and executable Python code that can be run on a Jupyter Notebook environment. Common open-source libraries are used to show that collected z/TPF system metrics do not need to be treated any differently than other data sources.

For a quick and hassle-free demo of the notebooks, a convenient "launch binder" button is located above to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image with all of the necessary software components and start up a temporary Jupyter Notebook session with the files in this GitHub repository.

## Dependencies

A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment containing the following libraries:
* Python (v3.5 or later)
* NumPy (v1.9 or later)
* Matplotlib (v3.0 or later)
* pandas (v0.24 or later)
* Seaborn (v0.9 or later)

The [Anaconda Python distribution (v2018.12 or later)](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is recommended for a bundled installation of Jupyter Notebook and the required Python libraries.
